## Car Rental System in Java - Detailed and Interactive Guide

This **Car Rental System** project is a console-based application implemented in Java. It allows customers to rent and return cars from a list of available vehicles. Let's break down the various components of the system and understand how they work together.

### Project Structure

- **Car Class**: Represents individual cars available for rent.
- **Customer Class**: Represents customers who rent cars.
- **Rental Class**: Tracks information about rentals, connecting customers and cars.
- **CarRentalSystem Class**: Manages the overall system including cars, customers, and rentals.
- **Main Class**: Entry point of the application that starts the Car Rental System and adds initial data.

### Key Features

1. **Car Renting**:
   - Displays available cars.
   - Takes customer details and allows them to rent a car for a specified number of days.
   - Calculates and displays the total rental price based on the daily rate and number of days.
   - Marks the car as rented.

2. **Car Returning**:
   - Allows customers to return previously rented cars by providing the car ID.
   - Marks the car as available again for future rentals.

3. **Car Availability**:
   - Cars that are rented are marked as unavailable, preventing them from being rented again until returned.

### Running the System

When you run the system, the following steps occur:

1. **Initialize the System**: The system is initialized with some default cars, such as Toyota Fortuner, Suzuki Swift, etc.
2. **Display Menu**: The main menu is displayed with options to rent a car, return a car, or exit the system.

   - It displays all available cars.
   - The customer selects a car by entering its ID and specifies the number of rental days.
   - The system calculates the total price and asks for confirmation before renting.
   - If confirmed, the car is rented and marked as unavailable.

2. **Return a Car**:
   - The system asks for the car ID.
   - If the car was rented, it is marked as available again.
   - If the car was not rented, an appropriate message is displayed.

3. **Exit**:
